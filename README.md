# Matrix Calculator
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/adedhi/matrix-calculator)

This is a matrix calculator, implemented in C. This program allows users to input and modify square matrices of dimensions 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4. It can compute the determinant and provide step-by-step procedures to find the row echelon form, reduced row echelon form, and inverse of the user's matrix.

## Features
- Calculates determinants, row echelon form, reduced row echelon form, and inverse of 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 matrices.
- Detailed step-by-step guidance for row operations and inverse transformations.
- Uses a command-line interface.
- C implementation allows for swift and accurate matrix operations.

## Requirements
- C Compiler
- Command-line interface (Terminal, Command Prompt, etc.)

## Installation
1. Download the code.

## Usage
1. Compile all .c files.
2. Run the executable.
